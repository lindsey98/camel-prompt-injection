"""Cascade "Stage 2" second-order semantic-template attacks (arXiv:2510.05244, Table 21).

Seven indirect-prompt-injection variants that keep the injection intent while dropping the explicit,
instruction-like surface forms that format-driven defenses key on. Several use a high-salience
*decoy* (an obvious fake injection) to draw the defense's attention while the true payload is framed
as trusted-looking metadata.

Each is a plain ``FixedJailbreakAttack`` (like ``important_instructions``), so it substitutes
``{goal}``/``{user}`` and drops into the same registry — select with ``--attack cascade_<variant>``.

NOTE: the paper describes each variant's strategy and shows example fragments but does not publish
verbatim template strings, so these are faithful reconstructions from Table 21's descriptions.
